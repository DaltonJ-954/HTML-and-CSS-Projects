    <p>So the Lakers are in a odd situation. How do they get things on track early rather         than later? Well one option is to tweak with starting and 2nd string rotations. Having       Beverly start seems to be a smart move, but he lacks scoring ability. A. Davis is still       in a category of "injury proned" players in the league, so to depend on him being there       in the long run is a trying thought. 
    
    For now we'll sit back and watch what transpires for the first half of the season to see     if the Lakers will be looking into free-agency with hopes of making their season a           championship type one. Wishful thinking maybe...</p>
